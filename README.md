# teac-cozy-codecademy

This is my submission for the Tea Cozy project for [My Home | Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn) 

The project focuses on understanding CSS Flexbox. [Flexbox - Learn web development | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) 

This concept has been a challenge for me in the past so it is nice to come back to it again and learn more thoroughly. I also learned a great deal on the subject playing the game [Flexbox Zombies](https://mastery.games/flexboxzombies/)

That's enough markdown links for one git commit. Now it's time to code the page itself.
